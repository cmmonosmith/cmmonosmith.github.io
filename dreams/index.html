<p>I keep a dream journal, whenever I'm able. I've been doing so since high school, and it's always been awesome. Obviously there are some I won't share, or details I'll omit, but for the most part this'll be it. Also the one here will be point-forward. 10 years of dreams is a bit much to transcribe from crappy sleepy handwriting.</p>

<p>Without further ado...</p>

<ul class="dream-link-list">
    {% for dream in site.categories.dream %}
        <li class="dream-link">
            <a href="{{ dream.url }}">{{ dream.title }}</a>: {{ dream.excerpt }}
        </li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>
