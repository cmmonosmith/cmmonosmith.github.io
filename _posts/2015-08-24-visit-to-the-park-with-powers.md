<p>was going on a trip with family<br>
stopped somewhere for a meal<br>
...?<br>
i took too long in a shower, my brother was making fun of me saying that some food that takes an hour to cook was almost ready<br>
...?<br>
heading into some park with my dad in his truck<br>
people were standing in the roadway because it was like a park but also a park entrance roadway here. benches, sandboxes, etc.<br>
people kinda freaked when we approached in the truck, but reacted idiotically, basically just standing there, or actually moving more into our path<br>
I commented on how dumb they seemed<br>
we passed them anyway, then this guy, parent to someone we passed, was standing in front of us<br>
he was telling us to take a turnaround up ahead and drive through again, but this time further away from people, gesturing in the air how close we were to some of them<br>
my dad replied by telling him to get his family in their car, take the turnaround up ahead, and drive the fuck out of there. pretty funny, actually.<br>
so we went on our way<br>
turns out this park area was full of public jungle gyms, restaurants, and hotels. also there were some poor residential areas.<br>
i went to a coffee place with my dad and got a chai latte or something, then i decided to head into my hotel<br>
my family was heading off somewhere else by truck and i had a flight somewhere the next day<br>
i hung out at the hotel for a while but then decided to check out the park area<br>
when i was leaving i passed by rich and some other work people at the pool area. i don't think they noticed me with my new hat on.<br>
from there i was using my phone's gps to try to find the best way into the park, but i was on the wrong side of the hotel.<br>
i wandered around looking for a good route, which was harder than it should have been, until i decided i needed to just walk all the way around the hotel to get to the other side<br>
it was getting dark, and this took me passed the poor residential area.<br>
i was using my phone as a flashlight when i passed some guy who started making conversation about it. seemed like he wanted it.<br>
his behavior became threatening, and then i did two takes on the next part.<br>
first, it got nightmarish, like maybe he had friends nearby who were going to jump me for it.<br>
second, redo, told him to fuck off and die, then explained how in detail. he backed off.<br>
headed down into the park area, it was no longer night time.<br>
met up with joey and we talked about where to get some food. he wanted to hit a bar for some beer, but i wanted coffee first<br>
stopped by the same coffee place as before but there was a long line and a new employee.<br>
ended up having to give my order to the new person, but she was super rude to me. she was making me explain in too much detail what i wanted in my coffee. and if i wanted almond, she'd have to clean extra stuff and that would hold up more customers. so i decided to get a chai latte again. she didn't know what chai was, so her coworkers yelled at her for being such an ass, but i played it cool<br>
while i was waiting for my latte, two cops walked in. this is where it got interesting; i had bizarre super powers<br>
also one cop was sue, and another was like a typically b-list actor playing a cop, tall guy, deep voice.<br>
they were looking for someone specific, so they didn't notice at first. i was flipping around a copy of the tall cop's head in my hands<br>
after a short bit of that, the sue cop noticed and whispered to her partner something about it. seemed freaked<br>
so the other cop confronted me about it, he asked wtf. i said it was just a copy of his head. totally normal. can't you do this?, i asked<br>
no, i freaking can't, he said. kept his composure well in public. but really the other patrons didn't seem, to notice.<br>
that's not normal, he said. put it away.<br>
i smiled and looked over at joey, hoping he'd pick up on what i was about to do somehow. i guess he did.<br>
so, i made my head a copy of his head, then saw through eyes like his.<br>
colors were different, mostly. also the scene changed. we were in some finished basement. there was that old-school wood panelling everywhere, and a teal carpet. the big cop was sitting in a la-z-boy recliner, again somewhat freaked about my power, but somehow fairly calm.<br>
i commented how cool it was, how the colors were different. almost somewhat muted. so i wondered... how it would be other way.<br>
so i gave the guy a copy of my head, and made him see through eyes like mine.<br>
only thing i remember him saying was "holy...", and then i pestered him about how it was seeing colors the way i did<br>
don't remember anything else.</p>
