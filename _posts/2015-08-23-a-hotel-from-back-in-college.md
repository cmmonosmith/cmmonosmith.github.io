<p>A dream I used to have in college was one where friends and I would go on a trip and stay at a particular hotel. The hotel did not have different floors with rooms numbered based on the floor. It simply had one massive spiral walkway with a gentle slope upward, and rooms spaced about the inside and outside of the spiral. I think it was endless. I never saw the top, at least. There were doors to stairwells placed about the outer wall, and I think I remember in each stair well, you'd only have to traverse what seemed like one flight of stairs to arrive at whatever part of the spiral you needed to be at. There were tables around the inner walls with lamps and phones for calling the lobby, and because of the slope, the lamps seemed likely to tip over. My friends and I mostly spent our time wandering up and down the hallways chatting about stuff.</p>
